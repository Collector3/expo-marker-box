### Attachment methods

[Adams Manufacturing 7500-77-3040 1/8" Suction Cup](https://www.amazon.com/Adams-Manufacturing-7500-77-3040-Suction-Small/dp/B00009UI7L)

Use the suction cup without the hook, and press into the holes at the top. For
best success, clean surfaces before attaching. Use the pull tab to detach
and realign as necessary.

[Badge magnets](https://www.amazon.com/totalElement-Magnetic-Fastener-Adhesive-10-Pack/dp/B00EHK287M)

Other badge magnets may work as long as they have 2mm of the magnet exposed. The
metal plate with adhesive backing should be kept for other purposes.

Press the magnetic part of the badge holder into the box, with the caution
symbols facing outward. Attach to a magnetic whiteboard/other magnetic surface.
